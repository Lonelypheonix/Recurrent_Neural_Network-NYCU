## Introduction

The objective of this project was to build a text classification model that can distinguish between AI-generated text and human-generated text. 

## Dataset
The “AI_Human.csv” file is a dataset containing text generated by both AI and
humans, labeled with a binary indicator (generated):
-   **0** for human-generated text
-   **1** for AI-generated text.
For details of the dataset, see the Kaggle website:

## Model

We experimented with two neural network architectures:

1.  A simple LSTM-based model.
2.  A hybrid LSTM-CNN model that combines recurrent and convolutional features.
